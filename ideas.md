Idea 1: More Robust Caching and Data Storage
The current script uses in-memory caches and a single JSON file for issue details. This works, but can be inefficient for larger libraries or repeated runs.

Suggestion: We could replace the JSON cache with a lightweight SQLite database.
Benefits:
Persistence: The cache would persist between runs, dramatically speeding up the processing of already-seen series.
Richer Data: We could cache not just issue details, but also series search results and full volume information.
Scalability: A database handles large collections more gracefully than a large JSON file.
Idea 2: Centralized API Client
The logic for making API calls is spread throughout the script, with a decorator for rate limiting.

Suggestion: We can create a dedicated ComicVineClient class to handle all interactions with the Comic Vine API.
Benefits:
Organization: This would centralize the logic for building requests, handling the API key, rate limiting, and parsing responses.
Maintainability: If the Comic Vine API changes in the future, we would only need to update the client class in one place.
Cleaner Code: The main processing logic would become cleaner and easier to read.
Idea 3: Fetch Richer Metadata
The script currently fetches essential information to rename the file. The Comic Vine API offers much more that could be valuable.

Suggestion: We could expand the data we fetch and write into the ComicInfo.xml.
Examples:
Story Arcs: 
(ie. "Spider-Verse", "Dark Reign")
Character, Team, and Location Credits: 
(ie. Spider-Man, Avengers, etc.)
Publisher Information
Alternate Series Names
Benefits: This would create a much richer and more complete metadata file for each comic, making your library more browsable and useful in comic reader applications like Komga or Kavita.
